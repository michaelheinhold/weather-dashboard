# Weather Dashboard

# About the project
This is a weather application that allows you to search any city and get current weather data for that location, including the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. As well as a 5 day forecast, with much of the same information, with the temp being the high for the day.
Each location searched is saved in a search history and the user is able to click on any item in the history and have that selection searched again.
